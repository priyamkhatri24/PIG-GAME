# PIG-GAME
This is my first user Interactive game made using JavaScript.

GAME RULES:

1. The game has two players, playing in rounds.
2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as the player wishes. Each result gets added to his round score.
3. But if player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost. After that its the next player's turn.
4. Player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his round score gets added to his global score. 
   After that its the next player's turn.
5. The first player to reach a global score of 100 wins the game.

HAVE FUN!!
